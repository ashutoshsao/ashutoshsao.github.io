    <h1>Installing Windows: A Complete Step-by-Step Guide</h1>
    <p>Installing a fresh copy of Windows might seem intimidating, but it's actually straightforward when you know the process. This guide will walk you through each step, explaining what's happening so you understand the "why" behind each action.</p>

    <h2>Why Install Fresh Windows?</h2>
    <p>Over time, your computer accumulates digital clutter—temporary files, registry entries, and software remnants that slow it down. A fresh Windows installation removes all this accumulated baggage, giving you a clean, fast system. You might also need a fresh installation if Windows is corrupted, infected with persistent malware, or if you're upgrading from an older version.</p>
    <p>Think of it like renovating your house. Instead of trying to clean around old problems, you start fresh with a solid foundation.</p>

    <h2>Before You Begin: Compatibility Check</h2>
    <p>Before diving into downloads and USB creation, verify your computer can run Windows 10 or 11. This two-minute check can save hours of wasted effort.</p>
    <p><strong>Check Your System:</strong></p>
    <ol>
      <li>Right-click "This PC" → Properties</li>
      <li>Verify "64-bit operating system" under System type</li>
      <li>Note your RAM amount (4GB minimum, 8GB recommended)</li>
    </ol>

    <p><strong>Check Available Storage:</strong></p>
    <ol>
      <li>Open File Explorer → This PC</li>
      <li>Your main drive (usually C:) needs at least 64GB free space</li>
      <li>Use Disk Cleanup if you need to free up space</li>
    </ol>

    <p><strong>Windows 11 Specific Requirements:</strong></p>
    <ol>
      <li>Press Windows key + R, type <code>tpm.msc</code>, press Enter</li>
      <li>If it opens showing "TPM Management" = you have TPM 2.0 (required for Windows 11)</li>
      <li>If you get an error = no TPM 2.0 (stick with Windows 10)</li>
      <li>Check if your processor is from 2017 or newer for Windows 11 compatibility</li>
    </ol>

    <p><strong>Decision Point:</strong> If Windows 11 requirements aren't met, Windows 10 is still excellent and supported until 2025.</p>

    <h2>What You'll Need</h2>
    <p><strong>Essential Items:</strong></p>
    <ul>
      <li>USB flash drive (8GB minimum)</li>
      <li>Internet connection for downloads</li>
      <li>External drive for backup</li>
      <li>2–3 hours of time</li>
      <li>Windows product key (optional—Windows might activate automatically)</li>
    </ul>
    <p><strong>Critical Warning:</strong> Installing Windows erases everything on your main drive. Back up any important files first!</p>

    <h2>Step 1: Backup Your Data</h2>
    <p>Connect an external drive and save:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Documents, Desktop, Pictures, Videos, Music folders</li>
      <li>Browser bookmarks and passwords</li>
      <li>Any other important files</li>
      <li>Software license keys for programs you'll reinstall</li>
    </ul>
    <p>This step is crucial—once we start the installation, your current files will be gone forever.</p>

    <h2>Step 2: Download Windows</h2>
    <p>Microsoft provides the Media Creation Tool that downloads the latest Windows version directly from their servers.</p>

    <p><strong>Download Process:</strong></p>
    <ol>
      <li>Visit Microsoft’s official website:
        <ul>
          <li>Windows 11: microsoft.com/software-download/windows11</li>
          <li>Windows 10: microsoft.com/software-download/windows10</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>Click "Download Now" for the Media Creation Tool</li>
      <li>Run the downloaded MediaCreationTool.exe</li>
    </ol>

    <p><strong>Using the Tool:</strong></p>
    <ol>
      <li>Accept license terms</li>
      <li>Choose "Create installation media for another PC"</li>
      <li>Select your preferences:
        <ul>
          <li>Language: Your preferred language</li>
          <li>Edition: Home or Pro based on your needs</li>
          <li>Architecture: 64-bit (x64)</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>Choose "ISO file" as media type</li>
      <li>Select save location</li>
      <li>Wait for download (30–60 minutes depending on internet speed)</li>
    </ol>

    <p><strong>Why ISO?</strong> Creating an ISO file first gives us more control over the USB creation process and allows reuse of the file.</p>

    <h2>Step 3: Create Bootable USB</h2>
    <p>We'll use Rufus, a free tool that creates bootable USB drives reliably.</p>

    <p><strong>Setup Rufus:</strong></p>
    <ol>
      <li>Download Rufus from rufus.ie</li>
      <li>Run the program (no installation needed)</li>
      <li>Insert your USB drive</li>
    </ol>

    <p><strong>Configure Rufus:</strong></p>
    <ol>
      <li>Device: Select your USB drive</li>
      <li>Boot selection: Click "SELECT" and choose your Windows ISO file</li>
      <li>Partition scheme: GPT (modern standard for computers after 2010)</li>
      <li>Target system: UEFI (non CSM)</li>
      <li>File system: FAT32 (automatically selected)</li>
      <li>Click "START"</li>
    </ol>

    <p>Rufus will warn that all USB data will be destroyed—click OK to proceed.</p>
    <p><strong>What's Happening:</strong> Rufus copies all Windows installation files to your USB and makes it bootable, allowing your computer to start from it instead of the hard drive.</p>

    <h2>Step 4: Configure UEFI Settings</h2>
    <p>Modern computers use UEFI (Unified Extensible Firmware Interface) instead of the older BIOS. We need to configure it to boot from our USB.</p>

    <p><strong>Access UEFI:</strong></p>
    <ol>
      <li>Restart your computer</li>
      <li>Immediately press F2, F12, Delete, or Esc repeatedly (varies by manufacturer)</li>
      <li>Look for "Press [key] for Setup" message during startup</li>
    </ol>

    <p><strong>Important UEFI Settings:</strong></p>
    <ol>
      <li><strong>Boot Mode:</strong> Ensure it's set to "UEFI" (should be default)</li>
      <li><strong>Secure Boot:</strong> Temporarily disable (Windows will re-enable this after installation)</li>
      <li><strong>USB Boot:</strong> Ensure it's enabled</li>
      <li>Save changes and exit (usually F10)</li>
    </ol>

    <p><strong>Why These Changes?</strong> We’re configuring your computer’s firmware to use modern UEFI standards and temporarily disable Secure Boot so our installation USB can start properly.</p>

    <h2>Step 5: Boot from USB</h2>
    <p>Instead of permanently changing boot order, we'll use the boot menu for a one-time selection.</p>

    <p><strong>Using Boot Menu:</strong></p>
    <ol>
      <li>Restart with USB drive connected</li>
      <li>Press F12 immediately when computer starts (or F8/F9/F11 depending on manufacturer)</li>
      <li>Select your USB drive from the menu</li>
      <li>Press Enter</li>
    </ol>
    <p><strong>Tip:</strong> If you miss the timing, restart and try again. The boot menu appears briefly during startup.</p>

    <h2>Step 6: Windows Installation</h2>
    <p>Once you boot from USB, you’ll see the Windows installation screen.</p>

    <p><strong>Initial Setup:</strong></p>
    <ol>
      <li>Choose language, time format, and keyboard</li>
      <li>Click "Next" then "Install now"</li>
      <li>Enter product key or click "I don't have a product key"</li>
      <li>Choose Windows edition (Home/Pro)</li>
      <li>Accept license agreement</li>
    </ol>

    <p><strong>Installation Type:</strong><br />
    You’ll see two options:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Upgrade:</strong> Keeps files and programs (only available when upgrading)</li>
      <li><strong>Custom:</strong> Fresh installation with full control</li>
    </ul>

    <p><strong>Choose "Custom: Install Windows only (advanced)"</strong> for a clean installation.</p>

    <h2>Step 7: Disk Partitioning</h2>
    <p>You’ll see your computer’s storage drives and partitions.</p>

    <p><strong>For Clean Installation (Recommended):</strong></p>
    <ol>
      <li>Select "Drive 0" (your main drive)</li>
      <li>Click "Delete" to remove all existing partitions</li>
      <li>Select the resulting "Unallocated Space"</li>
      <li>Click "Next"</li>
    </ol>

    <p>Windows will automatically create the necessary partitions for optimal performance.</p>
    <p><strong>What’s Happening:</strong> This removes everything and lets Windows create a fresh setup with proper partitioning structure.</p>

    <h2>Step 8: Installation Progress</h2>
    <p>Windows will now install automatically through several stages:</p>
    <ol>
      <li><strong>Copying files</strong> (15–30 minutes)</li>
      <li><strong>Preparing installation</strong> (5–10 minutes)</li>
      <li><strong>Installing features</strong> (20–40 minutes)</li>
      <li><strong>Installing updates</strong> (10–30 minutes)</li>
    </ol>

    <p>Your computer will restart several times—this is normal. Don’t turn off the computer or remove the USB drive until complete.</p>

    <h2>Step 9: Initial Windows Setup</h2>
    <p>After installation, Windows guides you through initial configuration:</p>

    <p><strong>Setup Steps:</strong></p>
    <ol>
      <li><strong>Region and Language:</strong> Confirm your location and keyboard</li>
      <li><strong>Network:</strong> Connect to Wi-Fi or ethernet</li>
      <li><strong>Account:</strong> Sign in with Microsoft account or create local account</li>
      <li><strong>Privacy:</strong> Adjust settings according to your preferences</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>Step 10: Post-Installation Tasks</h2>
    <p>Once you reach the desktop:</p>

    <p><strong>Immediate Tasks:</strong></p>
    <ol>
      <li><strong>Remove USB drive:</strong> Safely eject your installation USB</li>
      <li><strong>Check activation:</strong> Settings → Update & Security → Activation</li>
      <li><strong>Install updates:</strong> Settings → Windows Update → Check for updates</li>
      <li><strong>Install drivers:</strong> Windows installs most automatically, but check Device Manager for missing drivers</li>
    </ol>

    <p><strong>Graphics Drivers:</strong> Visit NVIDIA or AMD websites for latest graphics drivers if you have a dedicated graphics card.</p>

    <h2>Understanding the Process</h2>
    <p><strong>Why Fresh Installation Works:</strong> Unlike upgrades that layer new files over old ones, fresh installations create a clean foundation. This eliminates conflicts, removes malware completely, and ensures optimal performance.</p>

    <p><strong>Modern vs. Legacy Systems:</strong> This guide focuses on UEFI systems (computers after 2010) because they represent 95% of current computers. UEFI offers better security, faster boot times, and simpler installation processes compared to older BIOS systems.</p>

    <p><strong>Partition Management:</strong> Windows automatically creates several partitions—a small boot partition, main Windows partition, and recovery partition. This structure supports modern features like fast startup and recovery options.</p>

    <h2>Best Practices for Success</h2>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Take Your Time:</strong> Don’t rush through the process. Reading each screen carefully prevents mistakes that could cause problems later.</li>
      <li><strong>Verify Before Proceeding:</strong> Always double-check drive selections during partitioning. Selecting the wrong drive can erase important data.</li>
      <li><strong>Keep Installation Media:</strong> Save your Windows ISO file and keep the USB drive. You might need it for future repairs or installations.</li>
      <li><strong>Document Your Setup:</strong> Take notes about drivers you install and software you add. This helps if you need to repeat the process.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Final Thoughts</h2>
    <p>Installing Windows is a valuable skill that gives you complete control over your system. The process might seem complex initially, but each step has a clear purpose. Understanding these purposes helps you make informed decisions and troubleshoot issues when they arise.</p>

    <p>A fresh Windows installation typically results in noticeably faster performance, better stability, and a clean environment for your work. The time investment pays off in improved daily computing experience and the confidence that comes from understanding your system.</p>

    <p>The key to success is preparation—backing up data, creating proper installation media, and taking time to understand each step. With this knowledge, you can maintain your computer effectively and help others with similar challenges.</p>
